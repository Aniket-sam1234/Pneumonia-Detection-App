# “Pneumonia is a disease that often flies under the radar of not just the public but even the global health community.”
There is a deep learning model that works in the backend which is responsible for the image classification.
Our android application basically takes the X-ray plate image of the chest as input and performs classification whether it is Normal or Pneumonia with a accuracy value.
